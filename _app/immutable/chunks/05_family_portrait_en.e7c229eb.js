This hairstyle is very often accompanied by earrings in the form of single large pearls. Later, around 1640, more freedom was given to fringe and side curls; especially in women’s fashion, this harmonised with the soft drape of the dresses. In contrast to the bourgeois women, whose hairstyle required a bonnet, aristocratic ladies were allowed to display their artfully drawn curls openly."),yr.forEach(r),this.h()},h(){s(H,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/159"),s(H,"rel","nofollow"),s(x,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/45744"),s(x,"rel","nofollow"),s(C,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/1628"),s(C,"rel","nofollow"),s(M,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/1602"),s(M,"rel","nofollow"),s(S,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/3777"),s(S,"rel","nofollow"),s(P,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/607"),s(P,"rel","nofollow"),s(I,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/3776"),s(I,"rel","nofollow"),s(L,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/1560"),s(L,"rel","nofollow"),s(B,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/9350"),s(B,"rel","nofollow"),s(z,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/159"),s(z,"rel","nofollow"),s(W,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/9390"),s(W,"rel","nofollow"),s(G,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/10613"),s(G,"rel","nofollow"),s(q,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/10536"),s(q,"rel","nofollow"),s(Y,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/10946"),s(Y,"rel","nofollow"),s(J,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/10586"),s(J,"rel","nofollow"),s(j,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/10913"),s(j,"rel","nofollow"),s(D,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/607"),s(D,"rel","nofollow"),s(O,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/10550"),s(O,"rel","nofollow"),s(R,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/43003"),s(R,"rel","nofollow"),s(N,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/10426"),s(N,"rel","nofollow"),s(U,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/10427"),s(U,"rel","nofollow"),s(V,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/10421"),s(V,"rel","nofollow"),s(K,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/48310"),s(K,"rel","nofollow"),s(X,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/48311"),s(X,"rel","nofollow"),s(Q,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/9425"),s(Q,"rel","nofollow"),s(Z,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/45248"),s(Z,"rel","nofollow"),s($,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/10290"),s($,"rel","nofollow"),s(ee,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/353"),s(ee,"rel","nofollow"),s(te,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/25436"),s(te,"rel","nofollow"),s(ae,"href","https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api/resources/48313"),s(ae,"rel","nofollow")},m(o,f){c(o,A,f),e(A,We),c(o,ke,f),c(o,b,f),e(b,Ge),e(b,H),e(H,qe),e(b,Ye),e(b,x),e(x,Je),e(b,je),e(b,C),e(C,De),e(b,Oe),c(o,Fe,f),c(o,re,f),e(re,Re),c(o,He,f),c(o,u,f),e(u,Ne),e(u,M),e(M,Ue),e(u,Ve),e(u,he),e(he,Ke),e(u,Xe),e(u,S),e(S,Qe),e(u,Ze),e(u,de),e(de,P),e(P,$e),e(u,et),e(u,fe),e(fe,tt),e(u,at),e(u,I),e(I,rt),e(u,ot),e(u,L),e(L,st),e(u,it),e(u,B),e(B,lt),e(u,nt),c(o,xe,f),c(o,oe,f),e(oe,ht),c(o,Ce,f),c(o,h,f),e(h,dt),e(h,z),e(z,ft),e(h,ct),e(h,W),e(W,ut),e(h,pt),e(h,ce),e(ce,G),e(G,mt),e(h,gt),e(h,ue),e(ue,q),e(q,bt),e(h,wt),e(h,Y),e(Y,yt),e(h,vt),e(h,pe),e(pe,J),e(J,Tt),e(h,Et),e(h,me),e(me,j),e(j,_t),e(h,At),e(h,D),e(D,kt),e(h,Ft),e(h,ge),e(ge,O),e(O,Ht),e(h,xt),e(h,R),e(R,Ct),e(h,Mt),e(h,be),e(be,St),e(h,Pt),e(h,we),e(we,It),e(h,Lt),e(h,ye),e(ye,Bt),e(h,zt),e(h,ve),e(ve,Wt),e(h,Gt),e(h,Te),e(Te,qt),e(h,Yt),c(o,Me,f),c(o,se,f),e(se,Jt),c(o,Se,f),c(o,m,f),e(m,jt),e(m,N),e(N,Dt),e(m,Ot),e(m,Ee),e(Ee,Rt),e(m,Nt),e(m,U),e(U,Ut),e(m,Vt),e(m,_e),e(_e,Kt),e(m,Xt),e(m,V),e(V,Qt),e(m,Zt),c(o,Pe,f),c(o,w,f),e(w,$t),e(w,K),e(K,ea),e(w,ta),e(w,X),e(X,aa),e(w,ra),e(w,Q),e(Q,oa),e(w,sa),c(o,Ie,f),c(o,E,f),e(E,ia),e(E,Z),e(Z,la),e(E,na),e(E,$),e($,ha),e(E,da),c(o,Le,f),c(o,g,f),e(g,fa),e(g,Ae),e(Ae,ca),e(g,ua),e(g,ee),e(ee,pa),e(g,ma),e(g,te),e(te,ga),e(g,ba),e(g,ae),e(ae,wa),e(g,ya),c(o,Be,f),c(o,ie,f),e(ie,va),c(o,ze,f),c(o,le,f),e(le,Ta)},p:Ea,i:Ea,o:Ea,d(o){o&&r(A),o&&r(ke),o&&r(b),o&&r(Fe),o&&r(re),o&&r(He),o&&r(u),o&&r(xe),o&&r(oe),o&&r(Ce),o&&r(h),o&&r(Me),o&&r(se),o&&r(Se),o&&r(m),o&&r(Pe),o&&r(w),o&&r(Ie),o&&r(E),o&&r(Le),o&&r(g),o&&r(Be),o&&r(ie),o&&r(ze),o&&r(le)}}}const Fr={title:"A family portrait",isPublic:!0,lang:"en",color:"red",author:"Sabine de Günther",description:"The oil painting can be described and interpreted in multiple ways: At first glance, it shows three elegant young ladies and two gentlemen in a landscape. Each of the figures depicted is assigned an object, e.g. a bird or a mirror. These attributes refer to the five human senses - taste, smell, sight, hearing and touch - one of the most varied and appealing motifs in European painting. At the same time, the work is also a family portrait of five siblings of a family from the north-east of Baden-Württemberg, the former principality of the House of Hohenlohe. In addition, it depicts fashion from the time of the Thirty Years' War in Germany.",cover:"https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/files/large/3462bf943aaa761056dba91c89a90652c4833aaf.jpg"};class Hr extends Tr{constructor(A){super(),Er(this,A,null,Ar,_r,{})}}export{Hr as default,Fr as metadata};
